## Book Data Web App

This is a very simple app to generate and serve an html page
from the results of a query to our database's `book` table.
It is run by the Deno service in our Docker Compose setup.

There is a lot we can do with this. I think a next step will
be to explore some ways of generating a table to better display
the data. In the process we'll serve some CSS and maybe JavaScript
to improve the appearance and usability of the page. We will do
some research and consider options available for building sites
using a Deno backend.
