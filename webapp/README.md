## Book Data Web App

This is a very simple app to generate and serve an html page
from the results of a query to our database's `book` table.
It is hosted in the Deno service in our Docker Compose applications.

There is a lot we can do with this. We'll eventually serve some
CSS and JavaScript to improve the appearance and usability of the page.
We may explore some Deno-based frameworks for the front and back ends.
I think for this data an interactive table might be very useful, so we
will look into libraries for that or write it ourself.
