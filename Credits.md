# Sources and Credits

I found a lot of great information online while working on this.
I will try to site some of those here, especially the ones I drew
from more directly.

**gRPC Setup:**

We based our gRPC setup on the basic Go example in the docs [here](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/basics/).

**Dockerfile for Golang server:**

[This](https://hackernoon.com/running-a-grpc-service-with-docker) tutorial by Tiago Melo
has a Dockerfile that is setup to build a docker program and run it. We based our gRPC
server Dockerfile on this example.
